# OctaFlip
OctaFlip Online is a client-server implementation of the strategic 8x8 board game. This project brings the classic turn-based game to life, allowing two players to register, compete in real-time. Built entirely in C, it leverages TCP/IP sockets for network communication and JSON for a structured data interchange protocol.
